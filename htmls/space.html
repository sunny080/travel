                <p class="shogun">Dubai (/duːˈbaɪ/ doo-BY; Arabic: دبي‎, romanized: Dubayy [dʊˈbajj], Gulf Arabic
                    pronunciation: [dəˈbaj]) is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the capital
                    of the Emirate of Dubai.[5][6][7] Established in the 18th century as a small fishing village, the
                    city grew rapidly in the early 21st century into a cosmopolitan metropolis with a focus on tourism
                    and hospitality. Dubai is one of the world's most popular tourist destinations[8] with the second
                    most five-star hotels in the world,[9] and the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa.[10]

                    Located in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula on the coast of the Persian Gulf, Dubai aims to
                    be the business hub of Western Asia.[11] It is also a major global transport hub for passengers and
                    cargo.[12] Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was already a major
                    mercantile hub. A centre for regional and international trade since the early 20th century, Dubai's
                    economy relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial
                    services.[13][14][15][16] Oil production contributed less than 1 percent of the emirate's GDP in
                    2018.[17] According to government data, the population of Duba</p>
